For millennia, it has been a cornerstone of civilizations, a symbol of peace, prosperity, and wisdom. Today, in modern society, the olive continues to exert a powerful influence, woven into the fabric of our culinary traditions, health practices, and economic landscapes. Its importance lies not just in its delicious flavour and versatile uses, but also in its historical legacy, nutritional value, and sustainable production potential.\n",

Originating in the Levant region, it spread across the Mediterranean basin, becoming a fundamental element of the region's culture and economy. Ancient Greeks and Romans revered the olive, associating it with goddesses like Athena and using it to anoint victors and royalty. Olive oil, extracted from the fruit, was not only\n"
